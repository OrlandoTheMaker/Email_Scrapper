## Email_Scrapper
## Email Scraping Tool In Python

* This code uses the requests library to make a GET request to the website, and then the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML content. It then uses a regular expression to find all the email addresses on the website.

* Note that this code only finds email addresses that are written in plain text on the website. It won't be able to find email addresses that are hidden behind a contact form or obfuscated in some way.
